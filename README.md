# JA2BIAWeaponsParser
Parses a Jagged Alliance 2 Back In Action weapons.txt file and outputs the stats in CSV format so you can load it in Excel.

## How to use
I wrote this a while ago, so my memory is fuzzy. Edit the cs file and find the two paths at the top. The input file should point to an existing JA2BIA weapons.txt file. For safety I would make a copy and point the program to that. The output file should be a .csv file where the output will be written. Warning: The csv file will be overwritten if it's already there!

Build the program and run it. That should be it.

## No warranty, no maintenance
I don't play JA2BIA anymore for the moment, so am not updating this. I'm also not providing any support. Feel free to take it and do with it as you please, at your own risk.
